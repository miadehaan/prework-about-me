      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey! My name is Mia de Haan and I am new to web development. I'm so excited to be taking this course! I recently graduated from
          Portland State University with a degree in mechanical engineering but decided that that is not the career path for me.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Gainesville, Georgia but grew up in Tualatin, Oregon.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to be active and outdoors. I like to hike, camp, ski, workout, and take my dog swimming. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a full-stack web developer and potentially start my own business! I still have yet to determine 
          which industry I want to pursue a career in.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Beaverton, Oregon with my boyfriend and 2 dogs.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I wouldn't mind staying in Oregon, but I would love to live and work somewhere else like Denver, Colorado. It depends 
          on if the boyfriend agrees to it :)</p>
